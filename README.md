# Emty Intent Angular Project
An empty project intented to be used as a template for when starting up new projects. Angular front-end, JWT auth, Intent Architect managed models; services; repository patterns; dependency injection etc

## JWT Authentication
One of the largest influences in this repo has been [this post](https://fullstackmark.com/post/13/jwt-authentication-with-aspnet-core-2-web-api-angular-5-net-core-identity-and-facebook-login) describing how to create an Angular project with JWT authentication in ASP.NET. I've had to change a few of his methods slightly to work alongside Intent and I skipped the Facebook login part completely (might still add it later on...) but for the most part it seems to work

## Intent Architect
All services; db models; patterns; dependency injection gets done with the help of [Intent Architect](https://github.com/IntentSoftware/IntentArchitect) and advise from a few fellow devs

## Angular Material
Installation [here](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started)
I chose the deep purple and amber theme for now

## Angular Flex Layout
Repo/installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) and demos can be found [here](https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/docs)

## Font Awesome
Official Font Awesome component for Angular can be found [here](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/using-with/angular)

## Toast Messages
Toast messages used in the project can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-toastr)

## Typescript error handling
Implemented global error handling for typescript errors by following [this post](https://medium.com/@amcdnl/global-error-handling-with-angular2-6b992bdfb59c) and installing [stacktrace-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stacktrace-js)
